    > Using GetX as StateManager for many reasons :
    
    - Very fun / easy to get around , basically friendly .
    - DI (Dependency Injection) is something , one Instance injection on the root for example and you can get it anywhere else.
    - Routing / Navigating is fast and less code.
    - Internationalization way too easy.
    - State Management is much more easy and fun to play with , Easy to observe   variables that are expected to change relativey to the UI
    .
    - State Management , No need to work with Streams (since it take care of them behind ).
    - It Auto Dispose states.
    - SnackBars and dialogs pop up without the need of context (which was really   booring before xD )
    - Working with Storage easily.
    - Fast Theme Changing .
    - Inputs / data builtin Validations.
    
    
    **So it's basically, less code, fast , code friendly ...!**
